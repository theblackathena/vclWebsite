# vclWebsite

Added
1. Navigation with toolbar (check url to ensure it's working)
2. Nav button lights up when on respective page 
* These only work for the About and Projects pages so far.

Issues
1. Static webpage means A LOT of duplication. For now, only the root index.html file and template.html file I created should be edited. Only when completed should it be copied and pasted (w minor edits) to the other subdirectory html files.
